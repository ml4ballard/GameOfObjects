# GameOfObjects

## Description - 
Collaborate with your team-mate to complete this project. One team-mate will own the Github repository that the other will share.Both members on the team will push their work to the same Github repository. 

## Technologies Used

SpringTool Suite 4,
Packages, imports files, for loops, if else statements.
Working with fields visibility, arrays, allocating room on the heap using the word new, encapsulation and inheritance.

We also generated getters and setters for my private information.
Working with constructors to initialize the object. 

## Lessons Learned
 Working with the maze was more challenging and needed additional planning to expand the game.
 Additional time would be required to finish the Game project.
 Use all classes if we have them created.
 Communicate even more during the completion of the GameApp.
